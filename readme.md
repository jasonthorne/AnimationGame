This is a timed catch game, where the user has to catch as many falling apples as they can within 15 seconds.
The apples are programmed to each drop at a random time and speed. They are caught in a basket object controled with the left and right arrow keys. 
When an apple's coordinates collide with the basket's, a score is incremented, which is presented to the user both on screen, and in an alert message once the game ends.
The countdown timer is also shown on screen. There is also a message at the beginning of the game. This welcomes the user to the game, and instructs them on how to play.
